class Classe

    # This class provides basically everything you need.
    #
    # To make a new site to watch, just make a new ruby file next to it
    # and extend Classe, like I do in dhl.rb
    #
    # THen in the file, just initialize a new object with the correct URL:
    # class Lol < Classe
    # end
    #
    # d = Lol.new()




end
